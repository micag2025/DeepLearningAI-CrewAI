      " The bid & ask refers to the price that an investor is willing to buy or sell a stock. The bid is the highest amount that a buyer is currently willing to pay, whereas the ask is the lowest amount that a seller is currently willing to sell. The numbers next to the bid/ask are the “size”. The bid size displays the total amount of desired shares\n",

      "The bid-ask spread can indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate. You can use the bid-ask spread to determine whether to place a  market order or limit order when trading, helping you to optimize your price and have a successful order execution. \n",

      "Final Answer: Based on the latest market data snippets gathered from CNBC, AAPL is currently trading at $244.28, reflecting a slight decrease of $0.32 or -0.13%.

      "Price as of February 18, 2025, 10:27 a.m. ET\n",
      "Here's the latest on the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n",
      "2024 was a banner year for Apple (AAPL -0.24%), with the stock delivering a total return of 33%, and it currently holds the top spot among all publicly traded companies by market capitalization at $3.7 trillion. Given its position, investors might wonder how much room the tech giant has to grow.\n",
      "So, let's examine where Apple stands today, management's capital allocation strategy, and its outlook for 2025 to determine whether the stock is a buy, sell, or hold.\n",
      "Apple continues to impress, but growth is slowing\n",
      "Apple's latest financial results show that the tech giant continues to generate an unrivaled amount of revenue compared to its peers, with $391 billion during its fiscal year 2024. For comparison, Alphabet (GOOG -0.76%) (GOOGL -0.86%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.08%) generated $339.9 billion and $254.2 billion during that same period, respectively. \n",
      "However, Apple's year-over-year revenue growth is slower than that of its counterparts, at only 2%, compared to 10.6% for Alphabet and 11.7% for Microsoft. \n",
      "AAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts\n",
      "A closer look at Apple's sales by category reveals mixed performance across its segments. iPhone sales, the company's largest segment, reached $201.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, reflecting modest growth of just 0.3%. Meanwhile, sales in the iPad and wearables/home accessories segments declined by 5.7% and 7.1%, respectively.\n",
      "The bright spot for Apple continues to be its services segment, which includes Apps and in-app purchases, subscriptions, Apple Pay, and advertisement placements. For its fiscal year 2024, Apple's services generated $96.2 billion, equating to a year-over-year increase of 12.9%. \n",
      "Despite some lumpy sales growth, Apple continues to generate a staggering amount of free cash flow, which is the amount of money after operational and capital expenditures. For its fiscal 2024, Apple generated $108.8 billion, which is a 9.3% increase from the same period last year. For comparison, Alphabet and Microsoft generated $55.8 billion and $72.7 billion, respectively, over the trailing 12 months. \n",
      "Apple prioritizes returning capital to shareholders\n",
      "With Apple's robust free cash flow, management returns capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.4%. While the yield is relatively low compared to other dividend stocks, investors can reasonably expect annual increases for the foreseeable future, considering management has raised it for 13 consecutive years and has a low payout ratio -- the percentage of profits paid out as dividends -- of only 16.3%. \n",
      "In addition to a growing dividend, Apple aggressively repurchases its shares, boosting each shareholder's ownership stake without requiring additional investment. While buybacks are subject to a 1% tax, they are generally more tax-efficient than dividends, which are double-taxed -- first at the corporate level and then again when paid to shareholders.\n",
      "In 2024 alone, Apple reduced its outstanding shares by 2.2% and by an impressive 13.8% over the past five years. Notably, in its fiscal 2024, management spent nearly $95 billion on share repurchases and, in May, unveiled a new $110 billion buyback program. \n",
      "AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts\n",
      "Apple is betting on AI for future growth\n",
      "Like other tech giants, Apple is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential source of new growth. The company spent $31.8 billion in research and development during its fiscal year 2024, up 4.9% from its fiscal year 2023. In a recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted how Apple Intelligence, which is the company's free built-in AI system for its products, \"will transform how users interact with technology.\" \n",
      "The technology is only available on Apple's relatively newer hardware models, which could prompt more consumers to upgrade from their current devices.\n",
      "While still in its infancy stage, management believes that Apple Intelligence will grow its services revenue by \"double digits\" and the company's total revenue by \"mid-single digits\" in its fiscal Q1 2025 compared to its fiscal Q1 2024. \n",
      "Here's the bottom line on Apple stock\n",
      "Before investing in any stock, it's essential to consider its valuation -- after all, even a great company like Apple can become a poor investment if its price is too high.\n",
      "One metric available is price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF), which measures a company's market capitalization against its free cash flow. Currently, Apple trades at nearly 36 times its trailing-12-month free cash flow of $108.8 billion. Comparing this ratio to competitors' and Apple's historical valuation helps assess whether the stock is cheap, fairly valued, or overvalued.\n",
      "AAPL Price to Free Cash Flow data by YCharts\n",
      "Compared to Alphabet and Microsoft, which trade at 44 times free cash flow, Apple is less expensive. However, its current P/FCF ratio marks a five-year high. While the potential of the AI boom is exciting, much of the anticipated growth has yet to materialize, indicating that Apple's current valuation is rich.\n",
      "Despite this, Apple remains a compelling long-term investment, and current investors should consider holding. The company will continue to reward shareholders through rising dividends and share repurchases, and if its AI strategy delivers, it could pave the way for a transformative new growth phase.\n",

      "To effectively implement trading strategies for AAPL, here are the detailed execution plans for each requested strategy:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Long-Term Investment Strategy**:\n",
      "   - **Focus**: Capital growth through price appreciation and dividends.\n",
      "   - **Execution**: Invest in AAPL stock for the long term, leveraging its consistent dividend payments and potential for substantial price appreciation due to its innovations and market leadership in technology. Reinvest dividends to compound growth.\n",
      "   - **Considerations**: Monitor Apple's financial health, market position, and product innovation cycle. Adjust holdings based on significant changes in market conditions or company fundamentals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Swing Trading Strategy**:\n",
      "   - **Focus**: Capitalize on price movements within weeks or months.\n",
      "   - **Execution**: Utilize technical analysis to identify buy and sell signals. Implement tools like moving averages, RSI, and MACD to determine entry and exit points. Aim to buy on short-term weakness and sell on strength.\n",
      "   - **Considerations**: Stay updated with Apple's news that could cause significant price movements. Set stop-loss orders to manage risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Options Trading Strategy**:\n",
      "   - **Focus**: Generate income and hedge against price movements.\n",
      "   - **Execution**: Employ strategies such as covered calls for income and protective puts for downside protection. For aggressive traders, use strategies like straddles or strangles ahead of product launches or earnings announcements to capitalize on volatility.\n",
      "   - **Considerations**: Options trading requires understanding of complex financial instruments and risks. Keep track of expiration dates and implied volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sector Rotation Strategy**:\n",
      "   - **Focus**: Exploit cyclical performance variations across sectors.\n",

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Based on the gathered data and analysis, here are the key points and risks associated with the trading strategies for AAPL:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Volatility**: The current market environment has experienced fluctuations, as noted from the general trends and specific events like the SVB failure increasing equity market volatility. This volatility impacts all trading strategies but is particularly pertinent to Options and Swing Trading where timing and price fluctuations can significantly affect profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AAPL Performance**: AAPL has shown strong performance in 2023 with a significant return of 49.01%. This robust performance supports a Long-Term Investment Strategy as the company shows growth and resilience. However, the high performance might also increase the risk of corrections which could affect short-term trading strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Long-Term Investment Strategy**: This strategy seems favorable due to AAPL's strong performance and growth prospects. However, risks include potential market corrections and changes in technology sector dynamics which could impact AAPL's future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Swing Trading Strategy**: Given the market volatility, this strategy could be risky as it relies on short-term price movements. The recent performance indicates potential for profit, but the high volatility requires careful risk management and continuous market monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Options Trading Strategy**: The volatility can both pose a risk and offer opportunities in options trading. The key will be in selecting the right options strategies that capitalize on expected price movements without exposing the trades to undue risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Sector Rotation Strategy**: As AAPL is a major player in the technology sector, changes in sector performance due to economic shifts or technological advancements could impact this strategy. Monitoring sector performance closely and being ready to rotate when necessary will be crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while AAPL presents strong potential for profitability across various trading strategies, each comes with its own set of risks primarily influenced by market volatility and the inherent uncertainties in the technology sector. Effective risk management strategies and continual market analysis will be essential in navigating these risks.\u001b[0m\n",

      "Based on the gathered data and analysis, here are the key points and risks associated with the trading strategies for AAPL:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Market Volatility**: The current market environment has experienced fluctuations, as noted from the general trends and specific events like the SVB failure increasing equity market volatility. This volatility impacts all trading strategies but is particularly pertinent to Options and Swing Trading where timing and price fluctuations can significantly affect profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **AAPL Performance**: AAPL has shown strong performance in 2023 with a significant return of 49.01%. This robust performance supports a Long-Term Investment Strategy as the company shows growth and resilience. However, the high performance might also increase the risk of corrections which could affect short-term trading strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Long-Term Investment Strategy**: This strategy seems favorable due to AAPL's strong performance and growth prospects. However, risks include potential market corrections and changes in technology sector dynamics which could impact AAPL's future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Swing Trading Strategy**: Given the market volatility, this strategy could be risky as it relies on short-term price movements. The recent performance indicates potential for profit, but the high volatility requires careful risk management and continuous market monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Options Trading Strategy**: The volatility can both pose a risk and offer opportunities in options trading. The key will be in selecting the right options strategies that capitalize on expected price movements without exposing the trades to undue risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Sector Rotation Strategy**: As AAPL is a major player in the technology sector, changes in sector performance due to economic shifts or technological advancements could impact this strategy. Monitoring sector performance closely and being ready to rotate when necessary will be crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while AAPL presents strong potential for profitability across various trading strategies, each comes with its own set of risks primarily influenced by market volatility and the inherent uncertainties in the technology sector. Effective risk management strategies and continual market analysis will be essential in navigating these risks.\n",

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: To develop a detailed execution plan for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) using a long-term investment approach, the following strategy can be considered based on the current financial and market data:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Investment Thesis**: JNJ is recommended as a 'Buy' according to 17 analysts with a 12-month price target of $169.76, which represents an increase of 9.63% from the current price. This suggests confidence in the stock's future performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Financial Health**: As of 2024, JNJ reported revenue of $88.82 billion, marking a 4.30% increase from the previous year, and net income of $14.07 billion despite a significant decrease from the previous year. The company has a strong market capitalization of $372.83 billion and maintains a healthy dividend yield of 3.20%, indicating robust financial stability and attractiveness for long-term investors seeking income through dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stock Performance Metrics**:\n",
      "   - **EPS (TTM)**: $5.79\n",
      "   - **PE Ratio**: 26.75, which is relatively high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued based on earnings alone. However, the forward PE of 14.68 indicates expected growth in earnings.\n",
      "   - **Dividend**: $4.96 per share, providing a steady income stream.\n",
      "   - **Price Fluctuations**: The stock has a 52-week range between $140.68 and $168.85, showing moderate volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Market and Sector Position**: Operating in the healthcare sector, specifically in drug manufacturing and MedTech, JNJ engages in the research, development, manufacture, and sale of various products worldwide. This diversification across healthcare products provides a buffer against sector-specific risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Risks and Considerations**:\n",
      "   - JNJ faces ongoing litigation concerning its baby powder products, which could impact its financial stability and reputation.\n",
      "   - The company is also involved in high-stakes developments such as the rollout of new medical devices and vaccines, which, while potentially lucrative, carry significant development and market acceptance risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Actionable Steps**:\n",
      "   - **Entry Point**: Consider buying shares during price dips within the 52-week range, especially closer to the lower end at around $140 to maximize potential upside.\n",
      "   - **Portfolio Allocation**: Given the company's size and stability, a moderate allocation is advisable, balanced with other sectors to diversify risk.\n",
      "   - **Monitoring and Reassessment**: Regularly review JNJ's quarterly financial results, market news, and developments in healthcare regulations which may impact its business operations and stock performance.\n",

      " The bid & ask refers to the price that an investor is willing to buy or sell a stock. The bid is the highest amount that a buyer is currently willing to pay, whereas the ask is the lowest amount that a seller is currently willing to sell. The numbers next to the bid/ask are the “size”. The bid size displays the total amount of desired shares\n",

      "The bid-ask spread can indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate. You can use the bid-ask spread to determine whether to place a  market order or limit order when trading, helping you to optimize your price and have a successful order execution. \n",

      " Earnings Performance: Tesla's Q4 2024 earnings are anticipated to show continued improvement, with expectations of gross profit margins exceeding 20%. Analysts believe that the automotive segment's performance has stabilized after a challenging first half of the year, driven by increased deliveries and lower production costs.\n",

      "One might intuitively assume that Tesla’s CEO, with significant administrative resources at his disposal, would drive the stock to outperform on a longer period. This narrative held true, particularly after it became evident that the Republican candidate had won the U.S. election. Traders saw Musk’s association with that political circle as a strong buy signal, believing that many others would definitely jump in as well. As a result, price broke out of the resistance driving demand and pushing the stock higher. However, this effect did not last very long as many would have expected.\n",
      " WHAT HAPPENED? \n",
      "Tesla was once the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, both in the United States and abroad. However, its sales are now collapsing, driven by a combination of political and technological factors — many of which are tied to Elon Musk’s increasingly unusual behavior.\n",
      " The Sales Decline \n",
      "Since January 2024 Tesla’s sales have plummeted, particularly in Europe. Recent figures paint a bleak picture:\n",
      " Germany: 60% drop\n",
      " France: 63% drop\n",
      " Norway: 38% drop\n",
      " Sweden: 44% drop\n",
      "In the U.S., while the decline hasn’t been as drastic, Tesla’s share of the EV market is shrinking.\n",
      " What’s Causing Tesla’s Troubles? \n",
      "Several key factors contribute to Tesla’s struggles.\n",
      " Increased Competition \n",
      "Tesla’s early-mover advantage is disappearing. Established automakers like BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai and Kia, as well as newer EV startups like Rivian — now offer electric vehicles with longer range, faster charging, and more luxurious features. As a result, consumers have more choices, and Tesla is no longer the default option for EV buyers.\n",
      " A Cooling EV Market \n",
      "Some of the decline can be attributed to a broader slowdown in EV sales, particularly in Europe, where government subsidies have been scaled back. However, this alone does not explain Tesla’s sharp losses, especially compared to its competitors, many of whom are still seeing growth.\n",
      " For what Europeans could not forgive Elon? \n",
      "Musk's increasingly polarizing political stance like aligning with far-right figures or engaging with controversial accounts online — has alienated large segments of Tesla’s customer base in Europe and other liberal democracies. For a brand once associated with innovation and sustainability, Musk’s actions have tarnished Tesla’s reputation, particularly among progressive and tech-savvy buyers who once formed its core audience.\n",
      " Investor Confidence is Fading \n",
      "Tesla’s stock has been highly volatile, with investors growing uneasy about the company’s future. Over the past month, the stock price has declined, reflecting broader concerns about the company’s leadership and strategic direction.\n",
      " The Cybertruck’s Underwhelming Launch \n",
      "The Cybertruck, once hyped as a revolutionary product, has failed to live up to expectations. Instead of broad appeal, it has become a niche product, often associated with Musk’s most fervent and politically charged supporters. Rather than expanding Tesla’s customer base, the Cybertruck seems to have further divided it.\n",
      " The Bigger Issue: Musk’s Brand Overshadowing Tesla\n",
      "Tesla’s current crisis highlights a broader problem: when a CEO’s personal brand becomes larger than the company itself, it can have devastating consequences. Musk’s antics — once seen as part of his “genius entrepreneur” image — are now actively harming Tesla’s sales and market position.\n",
      "Many people who previously invested in Tesla stock and even owned a Tesla vehicle, they've since distanced themselves, not only due to concerns over vehicle quality but also because they no longer want to be associated with Elon. And while some of Musk’s supporters claim that Tesla will be just fine, the numbers tell a different story. Sales are falling, stock prices are shaky, and confidence in the brand is slipping. The 33% drop from ATH might be just the beginning of a larger cycle of selloff.by fract292929Scalping & Mid-Term Analysis for TeslaMarket Overview:\n",

      "\n",
      "Final Answer: To ensure the developed trading strategies for TSLA align with the user's high risk tolerance and day trading preferences, we should focus on strategies that capitalize on the stock's current volatility and high trading volumes. The recent data from TradingView indicates that TSLA has experienced significant price fluctuations, with a notable decline of 13.19% over the past month but an increase of 68.52% over the past six months. This volatility, coupled with a high beta of 2.50, suggests that TSLA is suitable for high-risk, high-reward day trading strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategies should include setting precise entry and exit points that leverage these swift price movements to capture gains. Utilizing stop-loss orders will be crucial to manage risks, particularly given the stock’s recent price dips and rebounds.

Show less What are your options - Tesla Earnings Trade SetupsEquities Koen HoorelbekeInvestment and Options Strategist Summary:  The article discusses Tesla's upcoming earnings release for Q2 2023 and suggests three potential trading strategies based on different market views. The market expects a significant up or down move of around 8% in Tesla's stock price following the earnings announcement.Tesla Earnings Preview: 3 Trade Setups Tesla Inc. (TSLA) is set to release its earnings for the quarter ending June 2023 on Wednesday, July 19th, after the market closes. The market is expecting some volatility, with an at-the-money (ATM) straddle suggesting an expected move/range of approximately +/- $22.61 by this Friday. Based on last Friday's close this means the market expects an up- or down-move of around 8%. With Tesla's Implied Volatility (IV) Rank at 21.64%, we are focusing on strategies that receive a credit upfront and profit from a potential collapse of IV post-earnings. It's important to note that the strategies and examples provided in this article are purely for educational purposes. They are intended to assist in shaping your thought process and should not be replicated or implemented without careful consideration. Every investor or trader must conduct their own due diligence and take into account their unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment objectives before making any decisions. Remember, investing in the stock market carries risk, and it's crucial to make informed decisions. Here are three trade setups to consider based on your market view: Bullish: Vertical Put Spread If you're bullish on Tesla, consider a vertical put spread. This strategy involves selling a put option while simultaneously buying another put option at a lower strike price. The goal is for the stock to stay above the strike price of the sold put. Here's the setup:Sell to Open: 21-Jul-23 275 PutBuy to Open: 21-Jul-23 270 PutYou are selling to open a put option with a strike price of $275 and buying to open a put option with a strike price of $270. This is a credit spread strategy where you receive a net premium of $208 (the difference between the premium received from the sold put and the premium paid for the bought put). The maximum risk for this trade is $292, which is the difference between the strike prices of the two options ($275 - $270 = $5) times 100 (since each option contract represents 100 shares), minus the net premium received. The maximum profit is the net premium received, which is $208. The breakeven point for this trade is $272.92. This means that you will start to make a profit if TSLA's stock price is below this level at expiration. The probability of profit is 62.82%. This is calculated based on the delta of the short leg. The trade has 4 days to expiration (DTE) and the implied volatility rank is 21.64%. The position greeks are as follows: Delta is 0.083, and Theta is 0.116. These values indicate the sensitivity of the position's value to changes in the stock price and time decay, respectively. Neutral: Iron Condor If you think that Tesla will stay in the expected move range right after the earnings, consider an iron condor. This strategy involves selling a call spread and a put spread on the same stock with the same expiration date. The goal is for the stock to stay between the strike prices of the sold options. Here's a possible setup:Buy to Open: 21-Jul-23 315 CallSell to Open: 21-Jul-23 310 CallSell to Open: 21-Jul-23 250 PutBuy to Open: 21-Jul-23 245 PutReasonHigh Implied Volatility (IV) due to numbers out on 19th July after market closeExpectationLimited movement in Tesla shares after releasing the figures and imploding IVBEPs on expiryProfit between $248.89 and $311.11Max RiskIf you get a premium of $1.11 the max risk/loss would be $5 - $1.11 = $3.89 per share. 1 contract = 100 shares. Max Risk/Loss = $3.89 * 100 = $389. It might be a good idea to wait and see what the premium will be just before the close of the market on Wednesday, as the IV will probably rise, and so will the premium to receive (improving your profit and lowering your risk).For Who?Only for clients to adhere to the view that the numbers will not cause a move outside the expected move in the share price of Tesla Trade set upSell the Iron Condor in the last 1 – 4 hours of trading on Wednesday 19th for around $ 1,45 - $1,50 (stagger in case of bigger positions)ClosingA GTC (Good Till Cancelled) order to close the position at $0,30 (stagger in case of bigger positions)EmergencyIf there is a big move in the underlying outside the bandwidth of the long strikes, monitor closely and close position latest on the 21th of July 2- 4 hours before expiryProbability of Profit79.12% (on expiration, based on delta's of the short positions)Expected Movefor 21th July ’23, based on ATM straddle: +/- $22.61IV Rank21.64%Bearish: Vertical Call Spread  If you think that Tesla will drop after the earnings-release, consider a vertical call spread. This strategy involves selling a call option while simultaneously buying another call option at a higher strike price. The goal is for the stock to stay below the strike price of the sold call. Here's a possible setup:Sell to Open: 21-Jul-23 285 CallBuy to Open: 21-Jul-23 290 CallThe net premium received for this trade setup is $154 (the difference between the premium received from the sold call and the premium paid for the bought call). The maximum risk for this trade is $346, which is the difference between the strike prices minus the net premium received. The maximum profit is the net premium received if TSLA stays below the strike price of the sold call ($290) at expiration. The breakeven point for this trade is $291.54, which is the strike price of the sold call plus the net premium received. This means that TSLA needs to be above $291.54 at expiration for the trade to be profitable. The trade has a probability of profit of 61.79%, and the implied volatility rank is 21.64. The position delta is -0.0706, and the position theta is 0.0727. These Greeks indicate the sensitivity of the position to changes in the stock price and time decay, respectively.

      " When the electric car company Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) launched its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, its shares closed the day at $23.89, a 40.5% gain over its starting price. Since that day, Tesla's path has been impressive if occasionally rocky, especially over the past few years.\n",
      " But long-term investors must be pleased: Tesla stock finished August 2024 at $214.11 a share, despite a five-for-one stock split in 2020 and a three-for-one split in 2023.\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "Tesla achieved profitability recently after years of hugely expensive startup costs.It maintained a 55% market share as of 2023, down from 62% the previous year.After a long period of market dominance, Tesla now faces competition from virtually every major vehicle manufacturer.\n",
      " Tesla's Beginnings The Tesla success story is widely known. Tesla did what the Big Three could not: produce a quality electric vehicle that is in huge demand.\n",
      "Contrary to popular belief, Elon Musk was not the founder of Tesla. Engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning created the company, while Musk entered the scene as an early investor.\n",
      " The company was founded in 2003 but didn't release its first car—the Roadster—until five years later. In 2012, the company replaced it with the Model S sedan. The same year, Tesla built charging stations in the U.S. and Europe, allowing Tesla owners to charge their vehicles for free.\n",
      " As of 2024, the company has several models on the market including the Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and the Cybertruck. Tesla also expanded its product line to offer solar panels and solar roof installation.\n",
      " Tesla was founded by two engineers, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning who named the company Tesla Motors. Their work caught the attention of PayPal co-founder Elon Musk, who invested millions during the early rounds of funding.\n",
      " Musk eventually became chair of the company before taking on the role of the chief executive officer (CEO).\n",
      " Tesla's Debt As an investor, you should first consider Tesla’s debt story and industry background in the automotive industry. Auto manufacturers require huge amounts of capital to invest in the manufacturing process.\n",
      " Tesla had to fuel its expansion by borrowing money. In the company's 2021 annual report, Tesla reported total liabilities of $30.5 billion. In 2022, the debt figure rose 17.37% to about $35.7 billion. In 2023, it was about $43.2 billion.\n",
      " On the asset side, Tesla had more than $29 billion in cash on hand at the end of 2023, a more than 31% increase over the previous year.\n",
      " Shareholder Equity A critical part of evaluating Tesla's capital structure relates to the company's retained earnings. After historically investing in heavy machinery, manufacturing space, and production efficiency, Tesla famously failed to incur a profit for years.\n",
      " Now, the company is finally reaping the benefits of its long-term strategy. Tesla ended 2023 with retained earnings of about $27.8 billion after a series of impressive annual gains from just $5.4 billion in 2020.\n",
      " Tesla Stock Splits With its stock hovering at about $500 a share in August 2020, Tesla announced a five-for-one stock split. The board of directors approved and declared a common stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Tesla said it made the decision to \"make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors\".\n",
      " In August 2022, Tesla announced a second stock split, at three to one.\n",
      " Tesla's Growth Over Time As of the end of 2018, Tesla's debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio was 4.76. Tesla was carrying over $23 billion of debt, while it has raised roughly $6 billion of equity. Fast-forwarding to the end of 2023, the company's capital structure has completely changed. The company's debt-to-equity ratio stood at 0.68.\n",
      " In mid-2024, Tesla reported a second-quarter profit of $1.48 billion. Its EPS was 47 cents per share. That was a 45% decrease in profit from the same period a year before.\n",
      "20,000%\n",
      "Investors who purchased Tesla shares on Jan. 1, 2012 would have gained almost 20,000% on their investment as of Jan. 1, 2022.\n",
      " Is Tesla Financially Stable?\n",
      "Tesla's financial health has substantially improved over the past few years. Tesla ended 2023 with retained earnings of about $27.8 billion after a steady series of annual gains from just $5.4 billion in 2020.\n",
      " What Is Tesla's Financial Strategy?\n",
      "Tesla's financial strategy of patience and long-term investing seems to have paid off. Tesla must continually increase efficiency, reduce cost, and expand manufacturing capacity. Now that the company is profitable, it might be able to solicit debt financing at lower costs than before.\n",
      " What Companies Does Elon Musk Own and Run?\n",
      "In addition to Tesla, Elon Musk owns SpaceX, a space exploration venture. He also owns the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. He is the CEO of The Boring Company, which is involved in tunnel construction and related infrastructure ventures. He is a co-founder and CEO of Neuralink, a company that is developing brain-to-computer interfaces. He is a co-founder of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research company.Overextended? You decide.\n",
      " The Bottom Line Tesla has made great strides in recent years and has become a profitable company.\n",
      " Its future is unpredictable. Virtually every car manufacturer from Acura to Volvo is introducing electric models. Tesla's competitors on the high-end side include Rolls-Royce, BMW, and Jaguar. On the affordable side are vehicles made by Ford, Fiat, and Mazda.\n",
      " In 2023, Tesla retained a 55% market share for electric vehicles, down from 62% in the previous year.\n",
      " Some of the big manufacturers have pulled back on EV production after seeing that immediate demand for them hasn't met their very high expectations.\n",
      " Those manufacturers have conventional gas-powered models and hybrid models to fall back on. Tesla doesn't, and that could be good news or bad news for its continued dominance of the market for electric vehicles.\n",

      "Final Answer: To develop a detailed execution plan for TSLA trading strategies that align with a high risk tolerance and day trading preferences, it is essential to capitalize on the stock's volatility and high trading volumes. Based on the latest information gathered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Entry and Exit Points**: Utilize technical analysis tools to identify precise entry and exit points. This includes monitoring TSLA’s moving averages, RSI, and MACD indicators for potential buying or selling signals. Given the stock's volatility, short-term trading strategies like scalping could be beneficial, where traders can capitalize on small price movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Use of Stop-Loss Orders**: To manage risk effectively, particularly in a high-volatility environment, setting stop-loss orders is crucial. This will help in limiting potential losses by automatically closing out positions if the stock moves against the anticipated direction.\n",

REUTERS/Go Nakamura/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabSummaryCompaniesTexas law allows Tesla's robotaxi service without special permitsMusk has repeatedly promised fully self-driving taxis are coming soonAustin has experience with Waymo and Cruise driverless taxisFeb 10 (Reuters) - Elon Musk told investors in late January that Tesla would roll out “autonomous ride-hailing for money” by June in Austin, Texas — a state where the company faces almost no regulation, raising questions about how much safety and legal risk Tesla is willing to take on as it deploys unproven driverless technology on public streets.Tesla has long blamed its customers for accidents involving the driver-assistance systems it calls Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), noting that it warns Tesla owners to stay ready to take over driving. Now Musk is vowing to deploy truly driverless taxis, a move legal experts say would place crash liability squarely on Tesla.Musk has promised fully self-driving Teslas for about a decade and failed to deliver. The promises have grown more frequent, with more immediate timelines, in recent months as Musk has shifted Tesla’s focus toward autonomous vehicles and away from mass-market EV sales.Yet Musk’s elusive comments continue to keep investors guessing about when — and at what scale, with what business model — Tesla will finally deploy fully self-driving technology that, to date, it has never displayed on public roads.Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Nothing in Texas law would stop Tesla from launching a robotaxi service. The state takes a hands-off regulatory approach that aligns with Musk’s increasingly anti-government political stances as an advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump.State law allows autonomous-vehicle companies free access to public streets provided they are registered and insured, like any human-driven car, and equipped with technology to record data about any potential crashes. No state agency issues permits for or oversees driverless-taxi services — and state law forbids cities and counties from enacting their own driverless-vehicle regulations.State Senator Kelly Hancock, who sponsored the state’s 2017 autonomous-driving legislation, said the legislature wanted to promote the industry’s growth in a competitive marketplace and avoid barriers to entry.“Being a conservative, I wanted to minimize government’s impact,” he told Reuters. “We can’t have a thousand different regulations. That’s how you kill an industry.”Musk moved Tesla’s headquarters to Austin in late 2021 from California, where regulators tightly control where and how firms can operate autonomous vehicles. The only two companies that have secured permits to operate paid driverless taxi services to date, General Motors' Cruise and Alphabet's Waymo, logged millions of miles with regulators under more restrictive permits before getting approval to pick up passengers. (Cruise has since halted robotaxi operations).On a January 29 earnings call, Musk said he expects to release an “unsupervised” version of its Full Self-Driving system in California this year. The two California agencies that regulate the industry told Reuters that Tesla has not applied for required permits to operate driverless vehicles or carry passengers and hasn’t reported testing data to the state since 2019.California has no specific standards for how much testing is needed for approval, but other companies that have navigated the process logged millions of autonomous-vehicle testing miles under state oversight. Tesla has logged just 562 testing miles since 2016, state records show.'THE CHALLENGE WITH ELON’Musk made his latest robotaxi promises the same day Tesla reported disappointing earnings, which missed analysts’ expectations and followed earlier news that Tesla posted its first-ever sales decline in 2024. Shares rose 3% the following day.He promised Tesla would launch “autonomous ride-hailing for money in Austin, in June.” Musk did not say how many cars, how customers would access them or whether the service would be available to everyone.The rollout of “unsupervised” FSD in California and “many regions of the country” would follow later this year, Musk said, without explaining whether that meant driverless-taxi services, a feature Tesla owners could buy, or some other offering.Musk did say \"unsupervised\" FSD would be capable of driving with \"no one in the car.\"Such comments often leave investors guessing what Tesla will actually deliver, and when, said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, a Tesla investor.“This is the challenge with Elon: You’re kind of reading through the tea leaves here and trying to extrapolate from some fragments what might actually happen,” he said. Mulberry added that he wasn’t particularly concerned about the specifics of Musk’s promises and timelines this year, provided Tesla shows progress: “The blueprint, I think, is there.”Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor focused on autonomous driving, said Texas requires no “pre-market approval” before Tesla can deploy driverless vehicles. Yet he doubted Tesla would attempt any broad deployment of autonomous technology - in Texas or anywhere - after what he called its underwhelming demonstration of a robotaxi concept, the Cybercab, last October on a Los Angeles-area movie-studio lot.“Tesla is not going to flip a switch and suddenly make all of their cars capable of driving by themselves, anywhere, under any conditions,” he said.Smith said the company might more likely attempt a small-scale test of its technology, possibly in limited areas of Austin in good weather, or with humans able to intervene by remote control to prevent crashes. “There are ways one could probably make that work,” he said.‘WE HAVE NO POWER’Autonomous vehicle testing and operation is allowed on Texas roads “as long as they meet the same safety and insurance requirements as every other vehicle on the road,” said Adam Hammons, a spokesperson for the state Department of Transportation.Austin has seen a surge in driverless vehicles on its streets over the last two years, which has led to resident and government concerns after a series of near-miss incidents involving pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles. In 2023, a group of more than 20 Cruise robotaxis caused a traffic jam near the University of Texas campus, blocking the street as they struggled to navigate around one another.GM declined to comment.The city has logged 78 formal complaints from law enforcement, emergency responders and residents since July 2023, which officials say may not capture all incidents involving the vehicles. One resident complaint from December described a Waymo vehicle blocking a lane of traffic for half an hour, causing “at least three very close call accidents.”The complaint added: “I can’t believe that y’all are allowing potentially deadly technology to be tested on the citizens of this city.\"A Waymo spokesperson said the company has worked with local leaders and first responders to “earn the trust of Austin’s communities” and is constantly working to improve its service.Police have run into problems where driverless vehicles don’t respond to hand signals from officers directing traffic, and the city has been unable to issue tickets to the vehicles, according to a spokesperson for Austin’s Transportation and Public Works department. The city recently came up with a way to submit complaints in municipal court when officers observe traffic violations.Tesla reached out to Austin officials last May, and city officials provided information about local fire and police procedures, maps of schools and school zones, and traffic rules during special events, the spokesperson said.Austin City Council member Zo Qadri, who represents downtown areas frequented by robotaxis, said he’s frustrated the city can’t impose rules on “private companies using these public roads as a testing ground.”“Ultimately,” he said, “we have no power.” Sign up here.Reporting by Chris Kirkham in Los Angeles and Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; editing by Brian Thevenot and Claudia ParsonsOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:DisruptedADAS, AV & SafetySoftware-Defined VehicleEV BatterySustainable & EV Supply ChainShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsChris KirkhamThomson ReutersChris Kirkham is a business reporter in Los Angeles who has covered topics including tobacco, worker safety, internet privacy and corporate sustainability efforts.

       "1. Market Volatility and Stock Performance: TSLA's stock has exhibited significant fluctuations, indicating a volatile environment that could impact trade entry and exit points.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Legal and Regulatory Developments: Tesla's plans to launch robotaxis in Texas by June highlight the regulatory environment differences between Texas and California. The hands-off approach in Texas poses legal and safety risks for Tesla, particularly regarding crash liability and unproven driverless technologies.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Earnings Reports and Legal Developments: Tesla's upcoming earnings reports and legal developments regarding autonomous technologies raise concerns about meeting ambitious timelines and technology capabilities, potentially leading to legal and safety issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Risk Management Strategies: The use of stop-loss orders and diversification strategies are crucial to manage potential losses in the volatile market environment.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Real-Time Data and News: Continuous monitoring of real-time market data and news is essential to adapt strategies quickly to sudden market changes and external factors that could impact Tesla's stock.\n",

       "In conclusion, while there are opportunities for profit in trading TSLA, the associated risks due to market volatility, legal and regulatory challenges, as well as the need for agile risk management strategies must be carefully considered to align with the organization's risk tolerance and trading preferences."

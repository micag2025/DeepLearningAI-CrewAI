    "In this notebook, we demonstrated `how to create a multi-agent system using the crewAI framework to plan, write, and edit a blog post on a given topic`. By leveraging the capabilities of different agents, we automated the content creation process, ensuring that the final output is well-structured, factually accurate, and aligned with the brand's voice. We also demonstrated that there is no relevant differences between using GPT-3.5 and HuggingFace models in the context of the notebook for generating content on this case on  \"Artificial Intelligence\"."

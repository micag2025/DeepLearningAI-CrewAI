    "## Introduction \n",
    "This notebook is designed to `demonstrate how to set up a multi-agent customer support automation using crewAI`. By the end of this notebook, you will have a clear understanding of how to create and manage agents, define their roles and tasks, and utilize tools to enhance their performance. This notebook will guide you through the process of setting up agents, defining tasks, and running the crewAI framework to handle customer support inquiries efficiently. You will learn about the six key elements which help make Agents perform even better:\n",

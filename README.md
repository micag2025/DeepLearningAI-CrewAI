Welcome to the AI-Agents repository! This repository contains  a collection of personalized  and reviewed code examples derived by two short courses offered on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/):

## Multi AI Agent Systems with CrewAI  
Learn how a team of AI agents can perform complex, multi-step tasks, instead of use a single large language model (LLM). CrewAI, an open-source library, automates processes like resume tailoring and event planning by assigning specialized roles and tools to agents. Key principles include role assignment, memory management, tool usage, and cooperation.


## Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI
Build multi-agent systems that collaborate, automate tasks, and integrate external tools. Learn to optimize agents using metrics and feedback. Deploy agent-based applications for project planning, data analysis, and content creation while enhancing workflow with multiple LLMs.


## ‚ùì What's Inside
  - _Customized Code Examples_: Original examples from the courses have been reviewed, refined, and personalized for improved clarity and usability.
  - _Hands-on Learning_: Apply your skills by creating agent crews that execute common business processes using Python and an LLM with CrewAI, an open-source library designed for building multi-agent systems.
  - _Practical Applications & Project-Based Learning_: Learn to build multi-agent systems for resume tailoring, interview preparation, technical writing, customer support automation, outreach campaigns, event planning, and financial analysis. Develop practical applications such as automated project planning, lead-scoring automation, data analysis support, and scalable content creation.
  - _Ready-to-Run Notebooks_: Test and modify pre-configured Jupyter notebooks.  
  - _Additional Resources_: Access links to documentation, model hubs, and supplementary learning materials.

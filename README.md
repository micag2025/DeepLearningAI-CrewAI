# DeepLearningAI-CrewAI

Welcome to the AI-Agents repository! This repository contains  a collection of personalized  and reviewed code examples derived by two short courses offered on the [DeepLearning.AI platform](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in collaboration with [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/):

## Multi AI Agent Systems  
Insight in how using a team of AI agents, instead of a single large language model (LLM), can enhance performance for complex, multi-step tasks. Learn how to use a crewAI, an open-source library that helps automate tasks like resume tailoring and event planning by assigning specialized roles, goals, and tools to different AI agents. The key principles of multi-agent systems are covered, including role assignment, memory management, tool usage, task focus, error handling, and cooperation.

## Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases with crewAI
Develop multi-agent systems that collaborate efficiently, automate tasks, and integrate external tools. Learn to test and optimize agents using performance metrics and human feedback. Gain insights into building and deploying agent-based applications for real-world use cases, such as project planning, data analysis, and content creation. Explore strategies for integrating different LLMs to enhance task execution and workflow efficiency.


## ‚ùì What's Inside
  - Customized Code Examples: Original examples from the courses have been reviewed, refined, and personalized for improved clarity and usability.
  - Apply your skills creating agent crews that execute common business processes, with Python and an LLM, using crewAI, an open source library designed for building multi-agent systems. )and also studied the key principles of AI agent systems.)
 - You will have also the opportunity to see how to build multi-agent systems, thus,  agent crews that execute common business processes, such as: tailor resumes and interview prep for job applications, research, write and edit technical articles, automate customer support inquiries, conduct customer outreach campaigns, plan and execute events and perform financial analysis.
 - Build several practical apps like an automated project planning system, lead-scoring and engagement automation, support data analysis, and content creation at scale.   
  - Ready-to-Run Notebooks: Test and modify pre-configured Jupyter notebooks.
  - Additional Resources: Links to documentation, model hubs, and supplementary learning materials.

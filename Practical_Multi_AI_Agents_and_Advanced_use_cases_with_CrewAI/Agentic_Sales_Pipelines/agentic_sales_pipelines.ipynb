    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the `creation of an agentic sales pipeline using CrewAI`. This involves setting up agents, tasks, and crews for lead qualification and email engagement. We will utilize YAML files for configuration and employ Pydantic models for structured data handling. Additionally, we will visualize the sales pipeline flow and kick off the entire process."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to set up an agentic sales pipeline using CrewAI. We created agents, tasks, and crews for both lead qualification and email engagement. By utilizing YAML configurations and Pydantic models, we ensured structured data handling. Additionally, we visualized and kicked off the sales pipeline flow. This approach can be extended and customized further for specific use cases in sales and marketing automation."
